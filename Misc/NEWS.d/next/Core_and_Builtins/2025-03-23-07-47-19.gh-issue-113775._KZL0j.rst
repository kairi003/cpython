Fix handling of the ``#HttpOnly_`` prefix in
:class:`~http.cookiejar.MozillaCookieJar` in the :mod:`http.cookiejar`
module. For this, a ``case_insensitive`` option has been added to
:meth:`~http.cookiejar.Cookie.has_nonstandard_attr` on the basis of RFC6265.
Additionally, the :data:`~http.cookiejar.HTTPONLY_ATTR` constant has been
changed from ``"HTTPOnly"`` to ``"HttpOnly"`` to improve consistency and
standards compliance.
